The JavaScript calculates the number of months in the dataset;
the net total amount of profit and losses for the period;
the average of the changes in the profit and losses for the period;
the greatest increase in the profit / losses for the period;
and the greatest decrease in the profits / losses for the period.

The JavaScript prints the results to the console.
